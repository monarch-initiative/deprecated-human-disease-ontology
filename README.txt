DEPRECATED

originally set up to help DO move toward full OWL axiomatization. This fork is now deprecated, but we keep it around as there may be some useful files in here

Welcome to the new Human Disease Ontology (DOID) Repository!

This repository will soon be active! It is intended for DO developers
and stakeholders to explore a better OWL-based development paradigm.

Please check back later!

If you are an editor or contributor to the GO, please read
README-editors.txt

The Jenkins job for this repo is here:
